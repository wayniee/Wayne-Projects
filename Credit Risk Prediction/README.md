## Overview
This project builds a **credit risk prediction** system for card approvals.  
Tghe project starts with raw applicant and credit history data, perform rigorous cleaning, and benchmark multiple models:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Tree**
- **k-Nearest Neighbour (KNN)**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Neural Network (Multi-Layer Perceptron/MLP)**

The project evaluates beyond accuracyâ€”**ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, Precision/Recall/F1**, calibration, and business trade-offs (false approvals vs rejections).
