# Improving Efficiency of Supply Chain

## Project Overview
This project aims to improve the efficiency of the supply chain through two approaches:
- Analysing supplier performance and identifying bottlenecks.
- Optimising order fulfillment processes to reduce delivery times.


## Project Objective
Through exploratory data analysis, this project aims to identify pain points in supplier performance and the order fulfillment processes through analysing metrics like the frequency of cancellations or returns and the time taken for each step in the order fulfillment process respectively.


## Approach
To identify the pain points in supplier performance, we:
1. Find the top products that are frequently returned or cancelled.
2. Find the time taken for suppliers to pack and ship out orders.

We then check the area these problematic suppliers are from to identify which suppliers need to improve on respective areas like product performance or packaging speed.

To identify pain points in the order fulfillment process, we:
1. Find the frequency of lost packages.
2. Find the proportion of late deliveries by different fulfillment agencies.
3. Find how late deliveries are by different fulfillment agencies.
4. Find which step in the order fulfillment process takes the longest time for each fulfillment agency.

We then check which fulfillment agency has higher incidences of these pain points so that we know which areas these fulfillment agencies need to work on to improve the order fulfillment process.
